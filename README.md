Reconnaissance Tool for Security Testing
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lareb, and this is a Python tool I built to help with security assessments.

What It Does
This tool helps gather important information about websites and servers by automating common security checks:

Finds domain registration details (WHOIS)
Checks DNS records (A, MX, TXT, NS)
Discovers subdomains
Scans for open ports
Identifies server software (banner grabbing)
Why I Built It
As someone who works in security, I wanted to create a simple tool that:

Saves time on repetitive tasks
Works from the command line
Can be easily extended
Produces clear reports

Getting Started

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recon-tool.git

Install requirements:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a scan:
bash
python recon_tool.py -d example.com
